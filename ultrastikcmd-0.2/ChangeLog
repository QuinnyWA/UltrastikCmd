	* Enabled application to work with newer Ultrastiks with Product IDs in the 051x range, 
          rather than 050x.
	* The newer sticks receive the information via a different USB mechanism than the
          earlier sticks (USB HID Output Report)
	* When sending a map, default border locations are applied if none are supplied by the
	  selected map file. The stick doesn't seem to like receiving all zeroes for border
          locations, not surprisingly.
	* Added a warning message when changing the stick ID - the stick must be physically 
	  disconnected before it will be recognized with the new identifier.
	* In the "old" transfer method, USB error checking has been added and appropriate 
          error output included.
	* Updated to revision 0.2
	* Ideally, this version should be deprecated and make use of newer USB libraries, but
          that's for another day.
	* Many thanks to Andy at Ultimark, and Aleph for a few words of encouragement.
